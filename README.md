# Terms:
> This bot makes API requests to YTS for getting Torrent links and solely acts as a bridge between the user and the YTS site. Torrenting movies (protected media) is illegal in most countries and by using this bot you may violate the piracy laws in your region. Devs are not responsible for any copyright, piracy lawsuites, legal claims arising from user using this bot. The bot cannot be entitled under illegal distribution piracy act as user is completely, at their own wish, using this bot for getting the Torrent links which could also have been obtained by accessing the YTS sites from any browser by the same user. So filing a lawsuite against the devs will be same as filing a lawsuite against the browser through which user was accessing the YTS sites. The dev does not encourage piracy. This bot was meant to help individuals who cannot afford a subscription based service for watching movies.
